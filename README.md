# 2-20-20Solitaire

A quick and dirty script we wrote at Learn Swift Boston on 2/20/20 to play a game of solitaire. The idea was based of the [Klondike Code Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata20-klondike/).

Instead of traditional Klondike, the script takes a single card off the top of the deck and attempts to put them, in rank order, into piles based on suit. If a card cannot be placed into an appropriate pile, it is added to the discard pile -- which can also be used to add a card to a pile.

We ran out of time, so there the script/game is not completed. Please feel free to fork the code and share your solution with us!
